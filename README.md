- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- sass

### What I learned

Okay in this challenge i learnt how to use some properties like filter transform and transiitons i also sharpened my
grid and flexbox challenges. I finished this challenge within 2 day ("I didn't use the whole 48hrs lets say max 6 hours
). Year at a point my head was banging maybe due to the section that had an image overlaying another image i knew i
could do it cause infact i had done something similar in the past took a code i worked on reviewed it went to sleep so
my head could cool down a little came back and implemented it .So the reason that section gave me a lot of trouble was
because i was using positioning and say start okay before approaching the middle it's trash again so after some thinking
and all i figured i'd use css grid. Now i expected the mobile navigation menu to give me alot of trouble but to my
greatest surprise it didn't more like a piece of cake
